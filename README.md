# Numerical Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of scripts developed for various numerical analysis techniques. Each script is designed to demonstrate a specific numerical method, ranging from function fitting and area approximation to function intersections and curve interpolation.

## Projects Overview

1. **Precise Function Fitting using Least Squares Regression**
   - Implements least squares regression to fit a precise function to a given set of data points.

2. **Numerical Integration and Area Approximation using Multiple Methods**
   - Utilizes several numerical integration techniques to approximate the area under curves.

3. **Interpolation Using Cubic Bezier Curves**
   - Demonstrates the use of cubic Bezier curves for interpolating between a set of points.

4. **Area Approximation Using the Shoelace Formula**
   - Applies the shoelace formula to approximate the area of polygons defined by sets of coordinates.

5. **Approximating Function Intersections Using Bisection**
   - Uses the bisection method to find intersection points of two functions.

## Installation

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your machine. Some scripts may require additional Python libraries, such as NumPy or Matplotlib. Install these by running:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. Navigate to the directory containing the script you want to execute and run:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you wish to run.
